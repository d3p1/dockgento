        # @note To set up Magento, we first need a
        #       functional Magento platform (as we will update its
        #       configuration using `bin/magento` commands).
        #       This is why it is executed `composer install`.
        #       Also, it is set `developer` mode in order to
        #       generate required class files
        #       (needed by the `bin/magento` command)
        #       on demand. Then, the `deploy` script will switch
        #       to the defined platform mode
        # @note To set up an already existing Magento project,
        #       it is required to manually update
        #       its `app/etc/env.php` file with the
        #       new environment database credentials.
        #       Because of that, it is required to execute
        #       the `app:config:import` command to avoid errors like
        #       `This command is unavailable right now.
        #       To continue working with it please
        #       run app:config:import or setup:upgrade command before.`
